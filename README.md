# Machine Learning
This is my test environment for the work done for my Advance Natural Language Processing class


# Correlation
The correlation plots may not seem straight forward so here is the breakdown:
1 - perfect positive correlation
0 - no correlation
-1 - perfect negative correlation

In this case, the less correlation the better it is for the algorithm.
