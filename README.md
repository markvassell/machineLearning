# General Information about the work


Logistic regression is a statistical method for analyzing a dataset in which there are one or more independent variables that determine an outcome.

Logistic Regression Assumptions

Target variable is binary
Predictive features are interval (continuous) or categorical
Features are independent of one another
Sample size is adequate â€“ Rule of thumb: 50 records per predictor

Uses for Logistic Regression
Stock Market Predictions
Customer conversion for sales
Continuation of support based on factors

This predicts an outcome, and it also provides a probability of that prediction being correct.

True Neg  | False Pos
False Neg | True Pos


# Correlation
The correlation plots may not seem straight forward so here is the breakdown:
1 - perfect positive correlation
0 - no correlation
-1 - perfect negative correlation

In this case, the less correlation the better it is for the algorithm.
